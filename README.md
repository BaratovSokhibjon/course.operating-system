## 🔧 Development Setup

This repository is optimized for:

- **C/C++**: System programming and kernel development
- **Linux/Unix**: Primary development environment
- **Development Tools**: GCC, GDB, Make, Valgrind
- **VS Code**: With C/C++ extensions and GitHub Copilot

## ⚙️ Key Technologies

- **Programming**: C/C++, POSIX API, system calls
- **Threading**: pthreads, synchronization primitives
- **IPC**: pipes, message queues, shared memory
- **Tools**: GCC, GDB, Make, shell scripting
- **Systems**: Linux, Unix variants

## 📝 Notes

- Programming assignments focus on system-level implementation
- Code examples demonstrate key OS concepts in practice
- Each topic includes both theoretical understanding and hands-on coding
- Compiled binaries and object files are excluded from version control

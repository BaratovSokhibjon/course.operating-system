# Operating Systems Course

This repository contains my study materials, implementations, and programming assignments for the Operating Systems course at Inha University. The repository is organized by **operating system topics and concepts** for efficient learning and reference.

## 🎯 Course Topics Coverage

### Operating System Fundamentals

- OS concepts, services, and structure
- System calls and system programming
- Kernel architecture and design principles

### Process Management

- Process creation, execution, and termination
- Multithreading and thread management
- CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority)
- Process synchronization (semaphores, mutexes, monitors)

### Memory Management

- Virtual memory concepts and implementation
- Paging and page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
- Segmentation and memory protection

### File Systems

- **File Management**: File operations, attributes, access methods, and file control blocks
- **Directory Structures**: Hierarchical organization, path names, mount points, and directory operations
- **Storage Devices**: Magnetic disks, SSDs, optical storage, RAID, and storage virtualization
- File allocation methods (contiguous, linked, indexed)
- Storage management and disk scheduling algorithms
- File system implementation and performance optimization

### Security and Protection

- Access control mechanisms
- Authentication and authorization
- System security principles

## 🔧 Development Setup

This repository is optimized for:

- **C/C++**: System programming and kernel development
- **Linux/Unix**: Primary development environment
- **Development Tools**: GCC, GDB, Make, Valgrind
- **VS Code**: With C/C++ extensions and GitHub Copilot

## ⚙️ Key Technologies

- **Programming**: C/C++, POSIX API, system calls
- **Threading**: pthreads, synchronization primitives
- **IPC**: pipes, message queues, shared memory
- **Tools**: GCC, GDB, Make, shell scripting
- **Systems**: Linux, Unix variants

## 📝 Notes

- Programming assignments focus on system-level implementation
- Code examples demonstrate key OS concepts in practice
- Each topic includes both theoretical understanding and hands-on coding
- Compiled binaries and object files are excluded from version control
